Methodology

Loading Libraries
Used pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical operations, seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations. 
Scikit-learn was used for model training, evaluation metrics, and splitting the dataset.

Building and Loading Dataset
The dataset was loaded from a CSV file. Basic inspection was done to display a few rows and understand the structure.

Data Summary
Generated summary statistics, including data types, number of samples, and basic descriptive stats like mean and standard deviation.

Data Visualization
Plotted distribution of selling prices using histograms. Created boxplots for features like kilometers driven and a scatter plot to show relationships between variables. A heatmap of feature correlations was also used.

Data Preprocessing
Removed duplicate rows and handled missing values. Outliers in selling price and kilometers driven were removed. Created new features like car age and brand. Applied one-hot encoding to categorical columns and standardized numerical columns using z-score.

Split the Dataset
Split the dataset into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio.

Choosing ML Algorithms
Selected multiple regression algorithms suitable for the prediction task including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor.

Training the Model
Trained each model using the training data. Evaluated performance using R squared, MAE, and RMSE. Saved the best performing model.

Inferencing
Used the trained model to predict selling prices for new car data based on user input features such as brand, fuel type, car age, and kilometers driven.
