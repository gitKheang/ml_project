 Evaluation Technique for Car Price Prediction Project:
We used regression evaluation metrics to measure the performance of our model:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalizes larger errors more than MAE, useful for detecting big mistakes.

RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination): Indicates how well the model explains the variability of car prices (closer to 1 is better).
